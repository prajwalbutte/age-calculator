This is a simple Python program that calculates your age in *years, **months, and **days* based on your birth date.

## 📌 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their birthdate in YYYY-MM-DD format.
2. The program calculates the difference between the current date and the birthdate.
3. It outputs the age in years, months, and days.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- datetime module

## 📋 Example
Enter your birth date (YY-MM-DD) :2006-06-30
You are 19 years,1 months and 11 days old
